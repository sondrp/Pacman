Pacman - to learn some fundamental computational rationality techniques (AI).
Things that can be implemented:

- Search:
 * DFS,
 * BFS,
 * UCS,
 * Greedy Search,
 * A* Search
- MultiAgent Project (Adversarial search)
 * Minimax
 * Alpha-beta pruning
 * Expectimax
- Markov Decision Processes & Reinforcemenet Learning
 * Value Iteration
 * Policy Iteration
 * Asynchronous value iteration
 * Prioritized sweeping value iteration
 * Epsilon greedy
 * Q-learning
 * Approximate Q-learning
